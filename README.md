<h1>Blackjack Game</h1>

<p>This is a simple implementation of the popular game of Blackjack. The program is written in Python and uses the <code>random</code> module to simulate the deck of cards. It also includes ASCII art to make it more visually appealing.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To play the game, you will need to set up a Python environment on your computer. You can find instructions on how to do that <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have a Python environment set up, you can clone the project from GitHub using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/{username}/{repository}.git</code></pre>

<p>You will need to replace <code>{username}</code> and <code>{repository}</code> with your own GitHub username and the name of the repository you want to clone.</p>

<p>After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the game using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python main.py</code></pre>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack. The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards, and the aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. Cards are worth their face value, with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) worth 10 and Aces worth either 1 or 11.</p>

<p>The player can choose to take additional cards ("hit") or keep their hand as it is ("stand"). If the player goes over 21, they "bust" and lose the game. If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than the player's, or the player busts, the dealer wins. If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, the player wins.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>The project requires the following Python modules to be installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>random</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These modules are included in the standard Python library, so no additional installation is necessary.</p>
